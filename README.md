**This project is far from done and is under active development! If you consider to clone this repository anyway please don't hate on us ^^**
# DocSort
Scan any documents, store them in an encrypted vault, access them everywhere and find them physically.

Build with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) and much <span style="color: red;">*♥*</span>.

## Feature list
This is what we planned for this project to build in:
* Secure and encrypted way to store important documents
* Simple and modern UI (built with Angular and Electron)
* Separate Backend & Frontend to enable Self-Hostable server to access your documents everywhere without payable service
* Everything is free, except donations (only If you want)
* Own android app to add and read documents
* Multi-Platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
* Portable version should be available
* Multi-User support (like I said, own server)
* Scan document content with OCR *and later with an AI maybe*
* Documents can be tagged
* Intelligent search that combines document content, tags, title and description
* Fully Open-Source without any malicious or spying code
* Create backups in your Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox or on own storage device

## How to install and run
Make sure you hava the latest node version installed (v11), If not, the backend will start with an error.
1. Clone this repository with all submodules (Backend and Frontend)
2. Go into the fackend folder and run `npm install`
3. Go into the frontend folder and run `npm install` too.
4. Now, everything is ready to go with `npm start`. Just run that command in the backend and frontedn folder.
